# CODEOWNERS - Workflow Security Protection
#
# This file ensures that workflow files containing secrets require
# explicit review before changes are committed.
#
# For a public repository with GitHub Secrets, this provides an
# additional layer of protection against accidental secret exposure.

# Workflow files (contain secret references)
/.github/workflows/ @samuelho-dev

# GitHub Actions configuration
/.github/actions/ @samuelho-dev

# Security-sensitive configuration files
/.nix-cache-setup.md @samuelho-dev
/.nix-cache-public-key @samuelho-dev

# Nix flake files (define builds that push to cache)
/flake.nix @samuelho-dev
/flake.lock @samuelho-dev
